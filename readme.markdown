A basic [PID controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) written in [Actionscript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) is used to control the hovercraft, with the position being set by mouseclicks. 

The simulation environment is made and displayed using the open-source [Box2D Physics Engine](http://box2dflash.sourceforge.net/).
